# Mandatory Programming Tasks BTI1013a

### Requirements

The programming tasks have been completed with Python v3.11.9 on a Windows computer, so pathing might need to be adjusted.

The workspace directory is where this README is located.


## Task 1: Matrix2Dim

To run the main function inside of `matrix2Dim.py`, you can simply run:

```bash
python .\matrix\matrix2Dim.py
```

For the unittests of the `Matrix2Dim` class, you need to execute the tests inside of `matrix\tests\Matrix2Dim_test.py` via following command: 

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s matrix -p "*_test.py"
```

## Task 2: Alien

To get the a valid path inside `alien.txt` can be computed by running following command:

```bash
python alien.py
```
